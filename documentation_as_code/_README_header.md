# Documentation as Code
Documenting inputs, outputs, used components and modules is important hygiene factor for any project. Generating documentation automatically from code is a great way to ensure that documentation is always up to date and consistent with the code. Make sure you provide description to your inputs and outputs in rich format, use multiline strings and provide examples.
